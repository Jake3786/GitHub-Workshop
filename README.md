# GitHub-Workshop

A practice repository for a student lecture I organized and ran with the Computing Club (MET Club) at my university (TWU). Part of an anticipated series of student lectures on interesting topics in STEAM.

This repository contains a text file for a story that all students attending the lecture/workshop have contributed to in some way, as a way to learn and get familiar with the basics of using Git and GitHub. As their introduction to Git and GitHub the hope is that they will use it in whatever way benefits them in their future.


## Tasks

- fork this repo
- add your own bit to the story file with a teammate (along with other exercises)
    <!-- TODO -->
